      <paragraph id="p3">
        The first quarter of 2025 witnessed unprecedented advances in large language model (LLM) 
        capabilities. The latest generation of models has demonstrated remarkable improvements in 
        reasoning, factuality, and multimodal understanding. Our benchmarks indicate that these 
        models now achieve 98% accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, compared to 82% in late 2024.

      <paragraph id="p4">
        The most significant breakthrough has been the development of "neural symbolic reasoning" 
        frameworks that combine the pattern-matching capabilities of neural networks with explicit 
        symbolic reasoning. This hybrid approach has revolutionized AI's ability to perform complex 
        multi-step reasoning tasks with verifiable steps.
