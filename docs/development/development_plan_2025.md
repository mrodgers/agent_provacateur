# Development Plan 2025 - Agent Provocateur

## Top 3 Priority Focus Areas

### 1. Entity Linking & Relationship Enhancement
- Improve GraphRAG Python implementation with enhanced disambiguation algorithms
- Integrate with additional external knowledge bases for better entity context
- Implement relationship mapping between technical concepts
- Add confidence scoring for entity relationships
- Create visualizations for entity relationship graphs
- **Testing Focus**: Unit tests for entity linking accuracy against reference datasets

### 2. Web UI Research Workflow Completion
- Finalize three-panel interface (Document Viewer, Supervisor Chat, Results Panel)
- Implement document upload/management with batch capability
- Add research configuration options (search depth, entity types)
- Create export functionality for validated XML output
- Add visual indicators for validation status and confidence
- **Testing Focus**: UI component tests and user flow testing

### 3. Integration Testing for Multi-Agent Workflows
- Develop comprehensive test scenarios for end-to-end workflows
- Test concurrent agent execution with Redis message broker
- Validate source attribution across the entire pipeline
- Measure system performance against PRD metrics (5 concurrent workflows, <1s latency)
- Test error handling and recovery across agent boundaries
- **Testing Focus**: Integration test suite with mock data fixtures

## Development Infrastructure Enhancements

### Package Management with UV
- Migrate all dependency management to UV for faster, more reliable builds
- Update requirements.txt and lock files to work with UV
- Document UV setup in DEVELOPMENT.md
- Create UV-based virtual environment setup scripts
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline uses UV for consistent builds

### Test Architecture Improvements
- Standardize on pytest fixtures for all test components
- Ensure test isolation to prevent environmental dependencies
- Add comprehensive test coverage reporting
- Implement test categorization (unit, integration, e2e)
- Create realistic test data that reflects actual user scenarios
- Automate test execution as part of the development workflow

### Documentation Updates
- Maintain alignment between code, tests, and documentation
- Update development guides with new patterns and practices
- Create detailed API documentation for agent interfaces
- Document message formats for A2A communication
- Update PRD tracking with implementation status

## Research Agent Alignment

- Ensure all agents follow consistent communication patterns
- Standardize error handling and retry mechanisms
- Maintain consistent source attribution format across agents
- Document agent responsibilities and boundaries
- Create unified logging approach for cross-agent workflow tracing
- Implement standard confidence scoring across all research components

## Success Metrics

1. Entity linking accuracy ≥90% against reference data
2. Multi-agent workflow completion rate ≥95%
3. Average inter-agent message latency <1s
4. DocBook validation success rate ≥98% for research output

## Quarterly Milestones

### Q2 2025
- Complete GraphRAG Python implementation with enhanced entity linking
- Finalize three-panel web interface with basic visualization
- Implement first wave of integration tests for multi-agent workflows

### Q3 2025
- Add relationship mapping between technical concepts
- Implement advanced document visualization and management
- Complete comprehensive integration test suite

### Q4 2025
- Integrate additional knowledge bases
- Add advanced entity relationship visualization
- Implement production monitoring and metrics
- Reach 90% test coverage for core components

## Alignment with PRD

This development plan directly addresses the core success metrics from the PRD:
- Handle 5 concurrent agent workflows with <1s average latency
- Entity definition accuracy ≥90% against reference set
- Final XML validating against DocBook schema
- Mock tool accuracy ≥95% 
- ≥80% pass rate on automated integration tests

The implementation of DocBook validation was a critical milestone in ensuring the system produces consistently structured and valid XML output with proper attribution, which underpins the overall research capabilities of the system.
