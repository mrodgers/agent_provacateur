‚úÖ Summary: What We‚Äôre Building

A Goal Refinement & Context Modeling Tool that allows the Supervisor Agent to:
	‚Ä¢	Interpret a high-level goal or prompt.
	‚Ä¢	Break it into structured tasks (tree format).
	‚Ä¢	Dynamically interact with the user for refinement.
	‚Ä¢	Map sub-tasks to available tools or agents.

‚∏ª

üß± Architectural Fit

üìç Existing Modules to Leverage
	‚Ä¢	supervisor.py (or equivalent): Primary coordinator.
	‚Ä¢	a2a/messaging.py: For delegation and tool dispatch.
	‚Ä¢	mcp_client/: Tool registry & metadata‚Äîcan be extended for capability matching.
	‚Ä¢	goals.json or other config storage: Can track user intent trees.

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

1. Add GoalRefiner Agent or Submodule

Create a dedicated GoalRefiner component or behavior within the Supervisor Agent.

# agent_provocateur/agents/goal_refiner.py

class GoalRefiner:
    def __init__(self, agent_capabilities: dict):
        self.agent_capabilities = agent_capabilities

    def refine(self, high_level_goal: str) -> List[Dict]:
        # Use langchain or LLMClient to break down the goal into sub-tasks
        plan = langgraph_generate_task_tree(high_level_goal)
        return self.map_to_agents(plan)

    def map_to_agents(self, plan: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
        for step in plan:
            step['agent'] = self.find_matching_agent(step['action'])
        return plan

Use langgraph or similar for multi-step prompting or tree-based decision making.

‚∏ª

2. Update Supervisor Agent Logic

Incorporate GoalRefiner as a sub-agent or method inside Supervisor‚Äôs plan-execute loop.

# agent_provocateur/agents/supervisor.py

from agent_provocateur.agents.goal_refiner import GoalRefiner

class Supervisor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.goal_refiner = GoalRefiner(self.agent_registry())

    def process_user_goal(self, user_input: str):
        structured_tasks = self.goal_refiner.refine(user_input)
        for task in structured_tasks:
            self.delegate(task)



‚∏ª

3. Create Interactive Clarification Mode

Allow Supervisor to call back to the user for disambiguation if:
	‚Ä¢	Tasks are vague or missing entities
	‚Ä¢	A match is not found in the agent registry

Use A2A or CLI prompt fallback:

if not task['agent']:
    clarification = prompt_user(f"Can you clarify: {task['description']}?")
    task['description'] = clarification



‚∏ª

4. Tree-Based Task Tracking (Optional v2)

Use a simple TaskTree structure to manage hierarchy and dependency between subtasks.

class TaskNode:
    def __init__(self, description, agent=None, children=[]):
        ...

Render this as JSON or Graphviz for visualization in the frontend later.

‚∏ª

5. Agent/Tool Capability Registry (Metadata Matching)

Extend the MCP tool mock registry to describe:
	‚Ä¢	What inputs each tool accepts
	‚Ä¢	What it can solve (e.g., ‚Äúsummarize‚Äù, ‚Äúcompare‚Äù, ‚Äúextract features‚Äù)

You can do this in JSON, YAML, or inline Python:

{
  "doc_parser": { "capabilities": ["extract entities", "compare versions"] },
  "search_tool": { "capabilities": ["find external sources"] }
}

Then match:

def find_matching_agent(action_text):
    for agent, meta in registry.items():
        if action_text in meta['capabilities']:
            return agent



‚∏ª

üìä Optional Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	LangGraph Planner Node: Turn GoalRefiner into a LangGraph node for better explainability and retries.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend Tree Editor: Let the user drag-and-drop or approve goal decomposition in a future GUI.
	‚Ä¢	Memory: Cache goal decomposition and user clarifications to prevent re-asking.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Why This Is a Clean Fit
	‚Ä¢	MCP & A2A already exist ‚Äì just need better goal modeling.
	‚Ä¢	Supervisor is modular ‚Äì easy to insert the refiner before tool execution.
	‚Ä¢	Tool mocking is well structured ‚Äì metadata matching is straightforward.
