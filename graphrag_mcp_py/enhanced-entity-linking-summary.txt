Enhanced Entity Linking for GraphRAG MCP: Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented advanced entity linking capabilities for the GraphRAG MCP Python server as part of Phase 3B enhancement #1. This implementation replaces the basic entity extraction with a sophisticated system that integrates external knowledge bases and provides contextual disambiguation.

Key components implemented:

1. Entity Linking Module (entity_linking.py)
   - EntityLinker: Main class for entity extraction and disambiguation
   - KnowledgeBase: Abstract base class for knowledge base integrations
   - LocalKnowledgeBase: Implementation of a local knowledge base
   - WikidataKnowledgeBase: Integration with Wikidata

2. Configuration Updates (config.py)
   - Added entity linking configuration parameters
   - Implemented feature toggles for gradual deployment

3. GraphRAG Integration (graphrag.py)
   - Enhanced extract_entities_from_text method
   - Improved _create_entity_relationships method
   - Added support for contextual disambiguation

4. API Enhancements (api.py)
   - Extended entity extraction endpoint with additional options
   - Added relationship information to responses
   - Implemented per-request configuration

5. Documentation
   - Comprehensive ENTITY_LINKING_ENHANCEMENT.md
   - Updated README.md with configuration options
   - Updated PHASE3B_SUMMARY.md with feature details
   - Added implementation summary documents

6. Testing
   - Created unit tests for entity extraction
   - Added tests for knowledge base operations
   - Implemented relationship detection tests
   - Added disambiguation testing

The enhanced entity linking system provides:
- Better entity extraction with external knowledge base integration
- Contextual entity disambiguation
- Improved relationship detection between entities
- Local knowledge base persistence
- Configurable entity linking features

This implementation significantly improves the quality of source attribution and retrieval in the GraphRAG MCP Python server, delivering on the requirements for Phase 3B enhancement #1.
