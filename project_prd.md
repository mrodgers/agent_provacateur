## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Multi-Agent Research System

### 1. Overview & Scope
The Multi-Agent Research System enables modular agents to collaboratively perform end-to-end research tasks against structured and unstructured data sources. The system leverages:

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized, context-rich interactions with tools and the LLM.
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication for dynamic task delegation and coordination.

**Success Metrics:**
- Handle **5 concurrent agent workflows** end-to-end with **<1 s** average inter-agent message latency.
- Mock tool accuracy ≥ 95% for simulated responses.
- ≥ 80% pass rate on automated integration test suite.

### 2. Goals & User Stories
**Personas:**
- **Research Manager:** Orchestrates high-level research tasks.
- **Developer:** Implements and tests agent behaviors and protocols.
- **QA Engineer:** Validates protocol compliance and system reliability.

**User Stories:**
1. **As a Research Manager**, I want to submit a research query via CLI so that a manager agent can coordinate sub-agents and return a consolidated report.
2. **As a Developer**, I want a mocked MCP server that simulates JIRA, PDF, and Web Search tools so I can test agent logic without external dependencies.
3. **As a QA Engineer**, I want predefined scenario scripts that inject errors and latency so I can validate agent robustness.

### 3. Phase 1: MCP Tools Development
**Objective:** Build and validate a mock MCP client–server architecture with simulated data sources.

**Deliverables:**
- **MCP Server Mock:** Supports `GET_DOC`, `FETCH_TICKET`, `SEARCH_WEB`, with configurable latency and error injection.
- **MCP Client SDK:** Python package exposing typed methods for tool calls and session management.
- **CLI Demo:** Basic CLI application demonstrating a multi-tool research workflow.
- **Documentation:** SDK reference, example usage, and protocol schema (JSON-RPC specification).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mock server responds within 0–500 ms by default; configurable to 0–1500 ms.
- SDK methods return deserialized objects matching OpenAPI schemas.
- CLI demo executes a complete workflow and prints a formatted report.
- ≥ 90% line coverage on unit tests.

### 4. Phase 2: A2A Communication Development
**Objective:** Enable structured, reliable communication and task delegation between agents.

**Deliverables:**
- **Message Schema:** JSON/Protobuf definitions for `TaskRequest`, `TaskResult`, and `Heartbeat` messages.
- **Pub/Sub Infrastructure:** Choice of broker (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka) with deployment scripts.
- **Agent Messaging Module:** Library for sending, receiving, and retrying messages.
- **Sample Workflow:** Demo where JIRA Agent → Doc Agent → Search Agent → Synthesis Agent collaborate on a query.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents exchange messages with < 1 s delivery latency under nominal load.
- Guaranteed-at-least-once delivery semantics with deduplication.
- Successful completion of demo workflow in ≤ 10 s.
- ≥ 80% pass rate on fault-injection test scenarios.

### 5. Testing & Validation
| Scenario                          | Description                                      | Expected Outcome                            |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Happy Path                        | Full MCP + A2A workflow without errors           | Final report accuracy ≥ 95%                 |
| Tool Error Injection              | Mock server returns 500 errors intermittently    | Agents retry and succeed; no crash          |
| High Latency                      | Simulate 1500 ms delays                          | Workflow completes in < 15 s                |
| Message Duplication               | Broker delivers duplicates                       | Agents dedupe with status-aware keys; no duplicate side effects     |

---

### 6. Future Considerations
- **Real API Integration:** Adapter layers for JIRA, Confluence, real web search.
- **Security & Permissions:** OAuth2 scopes per agent; encryption in transit.
- **Scalability:** Kubernetes deployment for MCP server and message broker; auto‑scaling agents.
- **Observability:** Metrics (Prometheus), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), centralized logging (ELK).
