# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Multi-Agent Research System

## 1. Overview

The multi-agent research system enables intelligent agents to collaboratively perform research tasks. It leverages:

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for structured interactions with data sources and the LLM.
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication for coordination and task sharing.

---

## 2. Phase 1: MCP Tools Development

### Objective
Develop a working MCP client-server architecture using mocked tools that simulate real-world data sources.

### Mocked Tools

- **JIRA Simulation**: Returns static ticket data based on queries (e.g., status, assignee).
- **Text Documentation**: Returns structured text content (markdown, plain HTML).
- **PDF Retriever**: Accepts URLs and returns mocked parsed PDF content.
- **Web Search**: Returns mock search results (title, snippet, source URL).

### MCP Client Behavior

- Sends structured requests (e.g., `GET_DOC`, `FETCH_TICKET`).
- Routes responses to appropriate agents.
- Maintains lightweight session context.

### MCP Server Behavior

- Registers mocked tools and routes requests accordingly.
- Standardizes input/output formats.
- Simulates latency, errors for robustness testing.

### LLM Interaction

- Agents query the LLM via MCP with context-rich prompts.
- Responses include summaries, action steps, classifications.

## 3. Phase 2: A2A Communication Development

### Objective
Enable agents to share, coordinate, and collaborate using structured messaging.

### Capabilities

- **Task Sharing**: Agents delegate or forward subtasks.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Summarize and transmit intermediate results.
- **State Awareness**: Awareness of peer agent status, task focus, and roles.

### Example Flow

1. Agent A retrieves JIRA tickets.
2. Agent B analyzes referenced documentation.
3. Agent C performs web searches for context.
4. Agents collaborate to synthesize final output.

## 4. Testing & Validation

- **Mocked Scenario Library**: Simulated end-to-end research workflows.
- **Unit + Integration Testing**: Covers tool calls, LLM prompts, A2A messages.
- **Agent Logging**: Comprehensive logs for task flow and tool interactions.

---

## 5. Future Considerations

- **Real Tool Integration**: Replace mocks with live APIs and services.
- **Security & Permissions**: Role-based access for tools and data.
- **Scalability**: Distributed agents, persistent memory, async coordination.
